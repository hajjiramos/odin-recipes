    <h2>Here is my version of Chicken Alfredo</h2>
        <p>I love cooking pasta. One of them is creamy and rich sauced 
            Chicken Alfredo using fettuccine pasta, 
            topped with tender strips of grilled chicken.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 3 chicken breasts about 2 lbs</li>
            <li> 2 tsp Italian seasoning </li>
            <li> 1 tbsp olive oil </li>
            <li> 2 tbsp butter </li>
            <li> 4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li> 1 cup heavy cream </li>
            <li> 3/4 cup grated Parmesan </li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp salt </li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp ground black pepper </li>
            <li> 1 tbsp chopped parsley (optional) </li>
            <li> 12 oz. fettuccine pasta</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season both sides of the chicken breast 
                with Italian seasoning and a pinch of salt.</li>

            <li>Grilled the chicken of your desired way. 
                Cook for about 7-8 minutes on each side, 
                or until browned on the outside and cooked through.</l1>

            <li> Put the grilled chicken to a clean plate.</li>

            <li> Heat a large skillet over medium.</l>

            <li>Add the butter and minced garlic to the skillet.
                Stir and cook the garlic in the melted butter
                for about two minutes or until golden brown.</li>

            <li>Add the heavy cream. 
                Allow the cream to come up to a simmer.</li>

            <li>While waiting for the cream to simmer, 
                bring a pot of water to a boil for the fettuccine. 
                Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil 
                until tender (about 7 minutes). 
                Reserve about Â½ cup of the starchy cooking water
                just before draining the pasta.</li>

            <li>Once the cream is simmering, add the Parmesan
                and whisk and stir until the Parmesan has melted.
                Simmer the sauce for a few minutes, 
                or until it becomes slightly thicker. </li>

            <li>Add salt and pepper to the sauce to taste.</li>

            <li>Add the drained pasta to the skillet with 
                the creamy sauce and mix. 
                If the sauce becomes too thick, 
                add a couple of tablespoons of the reserved 
                pasta water and toss to combine with the sauce.</li>

            <li>Slice the grilled chicken breasts and 
                serve it atop the creamy pasta. 
                Add some chopped parsley, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
